# Chat-Bot
Welcome to the pet-bot chat bot! Pet-bot starts by introducing herself and prompts the user to answer whether he/she likes dogs or cats better.
Pet-bot has 8 unique responses based on what the user says. There are three possible responses each if the user responds 'dogs' or 'cats'. If the user enters 'done'
pet-bot acknowledges and says goodbye, if the user enters anything else, pet-bot will notify the user that he/she has entered an invalid choice. Have fun with 
pet-bot and enjoy. :D
